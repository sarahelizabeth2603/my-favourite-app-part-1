        <p> I like cooking a lot . I noticed that whenever I am in any mood , incase in a bad mood if i cook then everything will be fine. I liked cooking from when I was small . when I was small my mother used to not allow me to cook with fire , she told if you want without  fire you can just pretend and play, I did this for some time. Then once my mom so me do this and she thought that if i did really cook on fir then it will be good . then she allowed me to cook in hr supervision and that's how I started my hobby to cook. Now I bake cakes , make chinese cusin , make ice creams , and lot more. Now in my family I am known as the junior cook. </p>
